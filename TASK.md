  *Description:* Develop REST API endpoints to expose scheduling and task management functionalities.
  *Dependencies:* Task 2.1 (Reimplementation Needed)
  *Comments:* Files exist, but functionality depends on missing scheduler/store (Task 2.1).

- [x] **Task 3.2: gRPC Interfaces for Internal Communication** `(Completed - 2025-04-06 - Blocked by Task 2.4)`
  *Description:* Define .proto files and build gRPC interfaces for communication between ops-core and agentkit.
  *Dependencies:* Task 2.4 (Reimplementation Needed)
  *Comments:* Files exist, but functionality depends on missing agentkit interfaces (Task 2.4).

- [x] **Task 3.3: Ops-core and Agentkit Integration** `(Completed 2025-04-06 - Blocked by Tasks 3.1 & 3.2)`
  *Description:* Integrate the scheduler with the core-agent by enabling API calls and processing responses.
  *Dependencies:* Tasks 3.1 & 3.2 (Blocked)

  *Description:* Implement Dramatiq with RabbitMQ broker for handling asynchronous agent task execution.
  *Dependencies:* Task 3.3
  *Comments:* Added `dramatiq[rabbitmq]` dependency. Created `ops_core/tasks/broker.py` for configuration. Refactored `InMemoryScheduler` to define `execute_agent_task_actor` and use `actor.send()` instead of `asyncio.create_task`. Created `ops_core/tasks/worker.py` entry point. Updated scheduler and integration tests (`test_engine.py`, `test_api_scheduler_integration.py`). RabbitMQ started via Docker. **Verified implementation by running `tox` (all tests passed) and fixing `pytest-asyncio` warning (2025-04-06).**

- [x] **Task 3.5: Integration Testing** `(Completed - 2025-04-06)`

- [x] **Task MCP.6: Add MCP Integration Tests** `(Completed & Debugged 2025-04-06)`
  *Description:* Create tests verifying the end-to-end flow: agent plans -> calls proxy -> ops-core calls MCP server -> result returns to agent.
  *Dependencies:* Tasks MCP.3, MCP.4
  *Comments:* Test with mock or real MCP servers if possible. Added test `test_scheduler_runs_agent_with_mcp_proxy_call` to `ops_core/tests/scheduler/test_engine.py`. Fixed `ToolSpec` validation error in `agentkit/tools/mcp_proxy.py`. Debugged initial `AssertionError` by patching `execute_tool_safely` to bypass multiprocessing, adding missing `OpsMcpClient.call_tool` method, fixing mock memory implementation, and correcting final assertions.
