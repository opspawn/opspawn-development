# PLANNING.md

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name and Description
**Opspawn Core Foundation** is an AI-first development initiative focused on building a modular, agentic infrastructure. The project comprises two core components:  
- **agentkit:** A lightweight toolkit to build LLM-powered agents with robust memory management, dynamic tool integration, and flexible planning capabilities.  
- **ops-core:** An orchestration engine that manages task execution, scheduling, and workflow coordination, ensuring seamless integration with agentkit via well-defined APIs.

### Objective
The immediate goal is to create a scalable, modular platform that enables the rapid development and deployment of intelligent agents and orchestrates their execution reliably. In the long term, Opspawn aims to evolve into a full-stack ecosystem that empowers developers and organizations to build AI-native software.

## 2. Vision & Objectives

### Vision Statement
Opspawn envisions a future where autonomous agents are integral to software systems—facilitating automation, intelligent decision-making, and seamless integration. Our platform will be the infrastructure of autonomy, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of AI-powered applications.

### Key Objectives
- **Modularity:** Develop highly composable components that allow rapid integration and customization.
- **Scalability:** Build a robust scheduling and orchestration system capable of handling high-volume, asynchronous tasks.
- **Interoperability:** Establish clear, versioned API contracts (REST/gRPC) to ensure smooth communication between modules.
- **Developer Experience:** Provide comprehensive documentation and a user-friendly CLI/UI for both internal teams and external contributors.
- **Security & Reliability:** Implement secure, stateless operations with robust error handling and logging mechanisms.

## 3. Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **agentkit:**  
  - **Memory Management:** Supports both short-term in-context memory and long-term persistent storage using vector databases.
  - **Dynamic Tool Integration:** Allows the registration and invocation of external tools through standardized interfaces.
  - **Planning & Reasoning Module:** Implements multi-step planning (e.g., ReAct, Plan-then-Execute) with a modular planner.
  - **Modular Design:** Clearly defined interfaces for memory, planning, actions, and security to allow easy extension.
  
- **ops-core:**  
  - **Task Scheduling Engine:** Manages job queuing, resource allocation, and retry policies with a distributed worker architecture.
  - **Orchestration Service:** Coordinates workflows, tracks state via a metadata store, and manages inter-task dependencies.
  - **Integration API:** Provides clear endpoints (REST for external and gRPC for internal use) for communicating with agentkit and other systems. Includes logic to optionally inject an **MCP Proxy Tool** into `agentkit` agents, enabling controlled access to external MCP capabilities.
  - **Monitoring & Logging:** Built-in observability for tracking execution progress, performance metrics, and error diagnosis.
  - Acts as the primary **MCP Host/Client**, managing connections and interactions with external MCP Servers.

### MCP Integration Strategy
Opspawn will integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using a dynamic proxy pattern. `ops-core` will function as the MCP Host and Client, responsible for discovering, connecting to, and communicating with external MCP Servers. For agents requiring external tool access, `ops-core` will inject a specific 'MCP Proxy Tool' into the agent's internal `ToolRegistry`. The agent can then plan to use this proxy tool to request actions from external MCP servers, with `ops-core` handling the actual MCP communication and policy enforcement.

### Deliverable Documents
- **Architecture Analysis Document:** Detailed analysis of design choices, performance benchmarks, and integration strategies.
- **API Contracts:** Versioned documentation (using OpenAPI for REST and Protocol Buffers for gRPC) outlining request/response schemas.
- **Integration & Testing Plans:** Comprehensive test plans for unit, integration, and load testing of all modules.

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** FastAPI (for REST endpoints), gRPC Python libraries, asyncio for asynchronous operations
- **Documentation Tools:** Sphinx or MkDocs (with Diátaxis framework), OpenAPI for API specs
- **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL or MySQL for metadata; vector databases for long-term memory management
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes (for scalable deployment)

### Constraints & Considerations
- **Stateless Operation:** Emphasize stateless API design to ensure resilience and scalability.
- **Security:** Implement sandboxing and access control for dynamic tool execution.
- **Performance:** Balance between ease of debugging (REST) and high-performance internal communication (gRPC).
- **Non-Goals:** This phase will not focus on packaging or deployment outputs; the emphasis is on internal architecture and integration.
