# Task 7.2 Debugging Chain Summary (2025-04-13)

## Objective

This document provides a high-level summary of the debugging process for Task 7.2 ("Execute & Debug Live E2E Tests") to clarify the sequence of failures, investigations, and hypotheses, making it easier to trace the origin and progression of the current issue.

## 1. Initial Failure: Live E2E Test Timeout

*   **Context:** Running the full end-to-end tests defined in `ops-core/tests/integration/test_live_e2e.py` (specifically `test_submit_task_and_poll_completion`) as part of Task 7.2.
*   **Symptom:** After resolving initial test setup issues (Docker paths, port conflicts, DB schema creation failures - see `memory-bank/debugging/2025-04-13_task7.2_live_e2e_schema_creation.md`), the test consistently failed. A task was submitted via the API, its status became `PENDING` in the database, but it never transitioned to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`. The test eventually timed out waiting for a final status.
*   **Hypothesis:** The Dramatiq worker process, responsible for executing the task actor, was not processing the message dispatched via RabbitMQ.

## 2. Isolation Attempt 1: Worker Isolation Script

*   **Action:** To isolate the worker behavior from the full E2E test setup (API server, complex fixtures), the `test_dramatiq_worker.py` script was created. This script directly submitted a task to the database, sent the corresponding message via Dramatiq/RabbitMQ, and launched the worker (`ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/worker.py`) in a separate process using `subprocess.Popen`.
*   **Symptom:** The isolated test reproduced the core failure. The worker subprocess started, connected to RabbitMQ (message status became "Unacked"), but critical logs placed at the entry point of the actor function (`_execute_agent_task_actor_impl`) were never printed. The task remained `PENDING`.
*   **Conclusion:** The failure was confirmed to be within the worker process's ability to consume the message and invoke the actor function when launched as a separate process.

## 3. Investigation 1: Worker Environment & Invocation Method

*   **Focus:** Why does the worker fail when launched via `subprocess.Popen` or directly via the `dramatiq` CLI within the `tox` environment?
*   **Steps & Findings:**
    *   Compared environments between `subprocess` launch and `tox exec` launch (minor differences, not causal).
    *   Tuned `subprocess.Popen` arguments (minimal effect).
    *   Added detailed logging: Revealed significant delay during `ops_core.scheduler.engine` import within the worker, suggesting module loading issues.
    *   Created `minimal_worker.py`: A simplified worker/actor still failed when launched via `subprocess.Popen` or the `dramatiq` CLI within the `tox` environment.
    *   Manual CLI testing (bypassing `subprocess` and `tox exec` wrapper) confirmed the failure persisted even when running the worker directly with the `.tox/py312` python interpreter.
    *   Pika debug logs showed successful connection and consumer registration (`Basic.ConsumeOk`), but no indication of message delivery or processing attempts.
*   **Hypothesis:** The issue likely stems from the Python environment created by `tox` (potential dependency conflicts, e.g., with `gevent` from `locust`) or a subtle interaction problem within Dramatiq/Pika's event loop when run via the CLI in this specific environment.
*   **Reference:** `memory-bank/debugging/2025-04-12_task7.2_worker_actor_invocation.md`, `memory-bank/debugging/2025-04-13_task7.2_subprocess_investigation.md` (Sessions 2 & 3)

## 4. Investigation 2: CLI Internals Trace

*   **Action:** To investigate the Dramatiq CLI's loading process, `python -m trace` was used to capture the execution flow when launching `minimal_worker.py` via the CLI. Output saved to `dramatiq_trace.log`.
*   **Findings:** The trace captured CLI startup, argument parsing, and initial module imports. Key differences in pre-loaded `sys.modules` compared to a direct actor call were noted. However, analyzing the large trace file to pinpoint the exact failure point during worker/module loading proved difficult with available tools.
*   **Status:** Trace analysis stalled.

## 5. Current Status & Next Plan (as of 2025-04-13 12:25 PM)

*   **Problem:** The Dramatiq worker fails to invoke the target actor function when launched via the `dramatiq` CLI within the project's `tox` environment, despite successfully connecting to RabbitMQ and registering as a consumer.
*   **Next Steps:** Follow the revised debugging strategy outlined in `PLANNING_step_7.2.7_revised_debug_plan.md`, focusing on:
    1.  (Optional) Testing the worker in a clean, minimal virtual environment to isolate dependency conflicts.
    2.  (Primary) Attempting to start the worker programmatically using Dramatiq's Python API, bypassing the CLI entirely.
