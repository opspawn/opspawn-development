# Debugging Log: Live E2E Test Schema Creation Issue

- **Date & Context:** 2025-04-13 (Morning Session)
- **Task:** [Task 7.2: Execute & Debug Live E2E Tests](../../TASK.md#task-72-execute--debug-live-e2e-tests)
- **Goal:** Run the live E2E tests (`test_submit_task_and_poll_completion`) and diagnose setup failures.

## Initial Symptom

Running `tox -e py312 -- -m live -k test_submit_task_and_poll_completion -v` failed during test setup.

## Debugging Log (Chronological)

1.  **Error:** `stat /home/sf2/Workspace/23-opspawn/docker-compose.yml: no such file or directory`
    *   **Cause:** Incorrect path construction in `docker_compose_file` fixture in `ops-core/tests/conftest.py`.
    *   **Fix:** Corrected path from `os.path.join(str(pytestconfig.rootdir), "..", "docker-compose.yml")` to `os.path.join(str(pytestconfig.rootdir), "docker-compose.yml")`.

2.  **Error:** `Bind for 0.0.0.0:15672 failed: port is already allocated`
    *   **Cause:** Existing Docker containers (from previous manual runs) were occupying the required ports.
    *   **Fix:** Ran `docker compose down` in the project root (`1-t/`) to stop and remove existing containers.

3.  **Error:** `sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: relation "task" does not exist` during test execution (API call trying to insert task).
    *   **Observation:** This occurred despite the test setup logs indicating the `run_migrations` fixture (using Alembic) completed successfully.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Alembic command reporting success but not actually creating the table, or creating it in the wrong place/context.

4.  **Attempt 1:** Modify `run_migrations` fixture to use `metadata.create_all` instead of Alembic. Add verification step using `inspector.has_table("task")`.
    *   **Result:** Verification failed. Logs showed `metadata.create_all` executed, but the inspector couldn't find the 'task' table immediately after.

5.  **Attempt 2:** Add detailed logging to check `target_metadata.tables` before `create_all`.
    *   **Result:** Logs confirmed `Tables known to metadata before create_all: []`. The shared metadata object was empty when the fixture ran.

6.  **Attempt 3:** Explicitly import `ops_core.models.tasks` within the fixture before `create_all`.
    *   **Result:** Still failed. Logs still showed `Tables known to metadata before create_all: []`.

7.  **Attempt 4:** Explicitly access `ops_core.models.tasks.Task` class attribute after import within the fixture.
    *   **Result:** Still failed. Logs still showed `Tables known to metadata before create_all: []`.

8.  **Attempt 5:** Modify fixture to use synchronous engine and synchronous `metadata.create_all`.
    *   **Result:** Still failed. Logs still showed `Tables known to metadata before operations: []`.

9.  **Attempt 6:** Modify fixture to use synchronous engine and raw SQL `CREATE TABLE task (...)`.
    *   **Result:** Schema creation *succeeded* (`Inspector found tables: ['task']`). However, subsequent fixture setup failed due to `NameError: name 'api_host' is not defined`, indicating file corruption from previous diffs.

## Root Cause (Conclusion of Session)

The persistent failure of `metadata.create_all` within the `ensure_live_db_schema` fixture (even synchronous versions) indicates a fundamental issue with how SQLModel registers tables with the shared `MetaData` object during the pytest/tox execution lifecycle. The `ops_core.models.tasks` module, despite being imported globally or locally, does not seem to populate the `target_metadata` object before the fixture attempts to use it for `create_all`.

Using raw SQL to create the table works, confirming the database connection and basic execution context are functional.

## Next Steps / Recommendation

- Fix the file corruption in `ops-core/tests/conftest.py` caused by repeated diff applications.
- Adopt the raw SQL approach within the `ensure_live_db_schema` fixture as a reliable workaround for setting up the database schema for live E2E tests.
- Optionally, investigate the root cause of the metadata registration failure in the test environment for a potentially cleaner long-term solution.
