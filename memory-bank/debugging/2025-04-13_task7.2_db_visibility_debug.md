# Debug Log: Task 7.2 - E2E Test DB Status Visibility Debugging

**Date:** 2025-04-13 (Evening Session 3)

**Goal:** Resume debugging Task 7.2 E2E test (`test_submit_task_and_poll_completion`) failure, focusing on why the worker appears non-functional despite previous fixes.

**Initial State (from previous session):**
*   `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture uses `subprocess.Popen` with `PYTHONPATH` fix.
*   Worker subprocess starts but doesn't seem to process tasks or produce reliable output/logs via fixture capture methods.
*   Internal file logging added to `ops_core/tasks/worker.py` (`worker_debug_log_{pid}.log`) as the next diagnostic step.

**Debugging Steps & Findings:**

1.  **Context Refresh & Plan:** Refreshed context, confirmed plan to run E2E test and check internal worker log. Documented plan: `memory-bank/debugging/2025-04-13_task7.2_check_internal_log_plan.md`.
2.  **Run E2E Test (Check Internal Log):** Executed `test_submit_task_and_poll_completion`. Test failed timeout as expected.
3.  **Check Internal Log File:** Used `list_files` - the `worker_debug_log_*.log` file was **not** created.
    *   **Conclusion:** Worker subprocess failed before executing the initial logging setup in `worker.py`.
4.  **Test Subprocess Output Capture:** Modified `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture command to run a minimal `python -c "print(...); sys.exit(42)"`. Ran minimal test `test_worker_fixture_startup`.
    *   **Finding:** Fixture setup ran, subprocess executed, output *was* captured, and premature exit (code 42) was detected.
    *   **Conclusion:** The fixture's core `subprocess.Popen` mechanism works in isolation. The failure must be specific to running the full worker script or interactions with other fixtures in the main test.
5.  **Identify Missing Fixture Request:** Realized the `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture wasn't explicitly requested as an argument in `test_submit_task_and_poll_completion`, hence it wasn't running during that test.
6.  **Add Fixture Request:** Modified `test_submit_task_and_poll_completion` signature to include `live_dramatiq_worker`.
7.  **Re-run E2E Test (Fixture Requested):** Executed test again.
    *   **Finding:** Fixture logs appeared. Worker subprocess logs appeared, showing successful initialization, task reception (`task_cae8a7d8...`), status update to `RUNNING`, and a call to `GoogleClient.generate`. The worker then hung waiting for the LLM response until the test timed out. Log also showed `Final Broker instance type: StubBroker`.
    *   **Conclusion:** Worker starts and runs, but hangs on the LLM call. The `StubBroker` log was potentially misleading.
8.  **Verify Broker Type:** Modified `worker.py` logging to use `dramatiq.get_broker()`.
9.  **Verify OpenAI Call (User Request):** Attempted `curl` test (failed due to env var access). Created and ran `temp_openai_test.py` using `tox` env python; confirmed `OpenAiClient` works with `gpt-4o-mini` and the API key is valid. Removed temp script.
10. **Force OpenAI in Fixture:** Modified `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture to set `AGENTKIT_LLM_PROVIDER=openai` and `AGENTKIT_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` in worker env.
11. **Re-run E2E Test (Forced OpenAI):** Executed test again.
    *   **Finding:** Worker logs confirmed `OpenAiClient` was used. Worker received task (`task_854895c5...`), updated status to `RUNNING`, called OpenAI API, received a response, but failed to parse it (`Failed to parse LLM response for action.`). Worker then logged updating status to `COMPLETED` and finished actor execution. However, the API polling loop still saw status as `RUNNING` and the test timed out.
    *   **Conclusion:** LLM parsing error occurred but worker completed. The primary blocker is the API endpoint reading stale DB status.
12. **Fix API DB Read (Attempt 1 - Refresh):** Modified `get_task` endpoint in `api/v1/endpoints/tasks.py` to depend on `AsyncSession` and call `session.refresh(task)`.
13. **Re-run E2E Test (API Refresh):** Executed test again.
    *   **Finding:** Same failure - API polling still saw `RUNNING` despite worker completing.
    *   **Conclusion:** Simple refresh is insufficient. Likely a transaction isolation issue.
14. **Fix API DB Read (Attempt 2 - Isolation Level):** Modified `dependencies.py` to set `isolation_level="READ COMMITTED"` on the engine.
15. **Fix API DB Read (Attempt 3 - Diagnostic Commit):** Added diagnostic `await session.commit()` before read in `get_task`. Test still failed timeout with API seeing `RUNNING`. Reverted diagnostic commit.
16. **Fix ReActPlanner Logging:** Corrected logger definition placement in `react_planner.py`.
17. **Re-run E2E Test (Planner Log Fix):** Executed test again.
    *   **Finding:** Planner parsing logs appeared, showing successful parsing of the OpenAI response (`Action: Final Answer: ...`). Test still failed timeout because API polling saw `RUNNING`.
    *   **Conclusion:** Planner parsing is fixed. DB status visibility remains the blocker.
18. **Fix API DB Read (Attempt 4 - Fresh Session):** Modified `get_task` endpoint to create a new session via `async_session_factory` instead of using `Depends(get_db_session)`. Test run interrupted before completion. File `tasks.py` was potentially corrupted by interruption.
19. **Restore `tasks.py`:** Restored `tasks.py` to the state before the last interrupted change (i.e., with `session.refresh()` but without the fresh session logic).

**Current Status (Task 7.2 - Paused):**
*   The E2E test `test_submit_task_and_poll_completion` consistently fails due to a timeout.
*   The root cause is identified as the API endpoint (`GET /tasks/{task_id}`) reading stale data (`RUNNING` status) from the database, even after the worker process has successfully executed the task and committed the `COMPLETED` status.
*   Attempts to fix this using `session.refresh()` and setting `READ COMMITTED` isolation level were unsuccessful.
*   The next planned diagnostic step was to force the API endpoint to use a completely fresh database session for each read, bypassing FastAPI's dependency injection for the session in that endpoint. This change was applied but the test run was interrupted.
*   The LLM response parsing error previously observed with OpenAI seems resolved.

**Next Steps (Planned before context reset request):**
1.  Re-run the E2E test with the "fresh session" modification in the `get_task` API endpoint to see if it resolves the DB status visibility issue.
