# Debug Log: Task 7.2 - Actor Refactor Attempt & Revert

**Date:** 2025-04-13 (Late Afternoon Session)

**Goal:** Attempt to resolve worker message processing issue by refactoring the actor definition out of `engine.py` into a dedicated `actors.py` module (Idea 3).

**Hypothesis:** Defining the actor in a simpler, dedicated module might improve Dramatiq's actor discovery/initialization across processes when invoked via `tox exec -- dramatiq ...`.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Plan:** Created `PLANNING_step_7.2.9_refactor_actor_location.md`.
2.  **Create File:** Created `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/actors.py`.
3.  **Move Code:**
    *   Moved `_execute_agent_task_actor_impl`, `_run_agent_task_logic`, `get_llm_client`, `get_long_term_memory`, `get_planner`, `DefaultSecurityManager`, and `AGENT_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT` from `engine.py` to `actors.py`.
    *   Moved the `@dramatiq.actor` definition (`execute_agent_task_actor`) from `engine.py` to `actors.py`.
    *   Added necessary relative imports to `actors.py`.
4.  **Update `worker.py`:** Changed import from `engine` to `actors` for discovery.
5.  **Update `engine.py`:** Removed moved code, cleaned up unused imports, added import for `execute_agent_task_actor` from `ops_core.tasks.actors`.
6.  **Test Worker Startup:** Ran `tox exec -- dramatiq ops_core.tasks.worker > worker_output_refactored.log 2>&1`.
    *   **Result:** **Success.** Worker started without errors and logs confirmed `execute_agent_task_actor` was discovered successfully via the new `actors.py` module.
7.  **Test Message Processing:** Ran `tox exec -- python send_test_message_clean_env.py` (twice).
    *   **Result:** **Failure.** The message was sent successfully, but the worker logs (`worker_output_refactored.log`) showed no indication that any worker process picked up or attempted to process the message. The "ACTOR ENTRY POINT REACHED" log was never printed.
8.  **Revert Changes:**
    *   Restored `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/worker.py` to import from `engine`.
    *   Restored `ops-core/src/ops_core/scheduler/engine.py` by moving the actor definition, implementation, helpers, and imports back.
    *   Deleted `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/actors.py`.

**Findings & Conclusion:**

*   Refactoring the actor location successfully resolved the worker startup and actor discovery issues previously encountered when using `tox exec -- dramatiq ...`.
*   However, this refactoring **did not** resolve the core issue: the worker processes still fail to consume or process messages from the queue when launched via this method.
*   This strongly suggests the root cause is not the location of the actor definition or complexity within the initially imported module (`engine.py` vs `actors.py`).
*   The problem likely lies in the execution environment or process handling specific to how `tox exec` launches the `dramatiq` worker command, potentially related to asyncio event loops, resource initialization within worker processes, or middleware interactions under these specific conditions.

**Next Step:**

*   Investigate running the worker directly within the activated `tox` environment (`source .tox/py/bin/activate && python -m dramatiq ops_core.tasks.worker`) to bypass the `tox exec` wrapper and isolate its potential influence.
