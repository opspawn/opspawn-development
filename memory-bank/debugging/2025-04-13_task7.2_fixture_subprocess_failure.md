# Debug Log: Task 7.2 - Worker Fixture Subprocess Failure Investigation (Session 2)

**Date:** 2025-04-13 (Late Evening Session)

**Goal:** Diagnose why the `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture in `ops-core/tests/conftest.py` fails to launch a functional worker subprocess, preventing E2E tests from running correctly.

**Context:**
- Previous sessions established that manually running the worker (`dotenv run -- .tox/py/bin/python -m dramatiq ops_core.tasks.worker --verbose`) works, but the fixture-launched subprocess does not process tasks.
- The immediate problem is that the subprocess launched by the fixture seems to fail silently *before* producing any stdout/stderr output, making direct debugging difficult.

**Debugging Steps & Findings:**

1.  **Initial State:** Test `test_submit_task_and_expect_failure` fails with a timeout, task stuck in `PENDING`. `live_worker_stdout.log` and `live_worker_stderr.log` are not created by the fixture (confirming immediate subprocess failure).
2.  **Attempt: Use `sys.executable`:** Modified the `cmd` in the fixture to use `sys.executable` instead of the relative path `.tox/py/bin/python`, along with a simple print command (`-c "import sys; print(...)"`).
    *   **Result:** Test still failed timeout. Log files (`live_worker_stdout.log`, `live_worker_stderr.log`) were **not** created. This ruled out issues with resolving the relative path to the interpreter.
3.  **Attempt: Minimal Environment:** Reverted `cmd` to the original `dramatiq` command. Modified the fixture to pass a minimal environment (`PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, `DATABASE_URL`, `RABBITMQ_URL`, LLM keys) to `subprocess.Popen` instead of `os.environ.copy()`.
    *   **Result:** Test still failed timeout. Log files were **not** created. This suggests the issue isn't caused by inheriting problematic variables from the parent environment.
4.  **Attempt: Prepend `dotenv run --`:** Added `dotenv`, `run`, `--` to the `cmd` list in the fixture to mimic the manually working command structure.
    *   **Result:** Test still failed timeout. Log files were **not** created. This indicates simply prepending the command doesn't resolve the issue within the `subprocess.Popen` context.
5.  **Attempt: Capture stderr via PIPE:** Modified the fixture to capture `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` and attempt to read it immediately after `Popen` and after a delay.
    *   **Result:** Test still failed timeout. No output was captured from the `stderr` pipe at either time point. `live_worker_stdout.log` was still not created.

**Conclusion:**
The `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture's use of `subprocess.Popen` is consistently failing to launch a functional worker process. The failure occurs extremely early, before the subprocess can execute even basic Python code or write to stdout/stderr/log files. The exact reason remains elusive but seems related to the execution context of `subprocess.Popen` within the pytest fixture environment, as the identical command works when run manually via `dotenv run -- ...`.

**Next Step Recommendation (for next session):**
Given the persistent failure of the fixture-launched subprocess, the most pragmatic approach is to rely on the **manual worker launch** method (Plan C) for proceeding with E2E testing and debugging the original `test_submit_task_and_expect_failure` logic error. Further attempts to fix the fixture subprocess launch seem unproductive at this time.
