# Debug Log: Task 7.2 - E2E Test Fixture Debugging

**Date:** 2025-04-13 (Evening Session)

**Goal:** Verify the fixes for worker invocation and DB commit race condition by running the live E2E test `test_submit_task_and_poll_completion`.

**Initial State:**
*   Worker invocation identified as the root cause of message processing failure in previous sessions.
*   Fix applied to `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture in `ops-core/tests/conftest.py` to use direct python execution (`.tox/py/bin/python -m dramatiq ...`).
*   Fix applied to `ops-core/src/ops_core/scheduler/engine.py` to commit DB transaction before sending Dramatiq message.
*   Fix applied to `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/broker.py` to respect `RABBITMQ_URL` env var.

**Debugging Steps & Findings:**

1.  **Run Test (Attempt 1):**
    *   Command: `tox exec -e py -- pytest ops-core/tests/integration/test_live_e2e.py::test_submit_task_and_poll_completion -m live -vvv -s`
    *   Result: Failed during `docker_services` fixture setup. Error: `Bind for 0.0.0.0:15672 failed: port is already allocated`.
    *   Hypothesis: Lingering Docker containers/proxies from previous runs.
2.  **Cleanup Docker:**
    *   Command: `docker compose down -v` (Completed successfully).
    *   Command: `sudo lsof -i :15672` (Showed `docker-proxy` still listening).
    *   Command: `sudo pkill -f docker-proxy` (Completed successfully).
3.  **Run Test (Attempt 2):**
    *   Command: `tox exec -e py -- pytest ops-core/tests/integration/test_live_e2e.py::test_submit_task_and_poll_completion -m live -vvv -s`
    *   Result: Failed during `docker_services` fixture setup. Error: `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed: port is already allocated` (PostgreSQL port).
    *   Hypothesis: Persistent Docker port allocation issue.
4.  **Modify Ports:**
    *   Changed host port mappings in `docker-compose.yml` to non-standard ports (Postgres: 5433, RabbitMQ AMQP: 5673, RabbitMQ Mgmt: 15673).
5.  **Run Test (Attempt 3):**
    *   Command: `tox exec -e py -- pytest ops-core/tests/integration/test_live_e2e.py::test_submit_task_and_poll_completion -m live -vvv -s`
    *   Result: Failed during `docker_services` fixture setup. Error: `failed to create network pytest...: could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool`.
    *   Hypothesis: Exhausted Docker network IP pools due to previous test runs.
6.  **Prune Docker Networks:**
    *   Command: `docker network prune -f` (Completed successfully, removed many old networks).
7.  **Run Test (Attempt 4):**
    *   Command: `tox exec -e py -- pytest ops-core/tests/integration/test_live_e2e.py::test_submit_task_and_poll_completion -m live -vvv -s`
    *   Result: Failed during `docker_services` fixture setup. Error: `Bind for 0.0.0.0:15673 failed: port is already allocated` (New RabbitMQ Mgmt port).
    *   Hypothesis: Deep Docker state issue or `pytest-docker` interaction problem.
8.  **Restart Docker Daemon:**
    *   Command: `sudo systemctl restart docker` (Completed successfully).
9.  **Run Test (Attempt 5):**
    *   Command: `tox exec -e py -- pytest ops-core/tests/integration/test_live_e2e.py::test_submit_task_and_poll_completion -m live -vvv -s`
    *   Result: Failed during `docker_services` fixture setup. Error: `Bind for 0.0.0.0:15673 failed: port is already allocated`.
    *   Conclusion: Restarting Docker did not resolve the phantom port conflict.
10. **Revert Ports:**
    *   Changed host port mappings in `docker-compose.yml` back to standard defaults (5432, 5672, 15672).
11. **Run Test (Attempt 6):**
    *   Command: `tox exec -e py -- pytest ops-core/tests/integration/test_live_e2e.py::test_submit_task_and_poll_completion -m live -vvv -s`
    *   Result: Test ran but failed with timeout. Task status remained `pending`.
    *   Check Worker Log: Attempted `read_file` for `live_worker_output.log`. Result: File not found.
    *   Hypothesis: Worker process launched by fixture subprocess is failing immediately. Potential issue with `cwd` or environment differences vs manual execution.
12. **Set `cwd` in Fixture:**
    *   Modified `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture in `conftest.py` to explicitly set `cwd=project_root`.
13. **Run Test (Attempt 7):**
    *   Command: `tox exec -e py -- pytest ops-core/tests/integration/test_live_e2e.py::test_submit_task_and_poll_completion -m live -vvv -s`
    *   Result: Test ran but failed with timeout. Task status remained `pending`.
    *   Check Worker Log: Attempted `read_file` for `live_worker_output.log`. Result: File not found.
    *   Conclusion: Setting `cwd` did not resolve the immediate worker failure within the fixture.

**Overall Conclusion & Current State:**

*   The original worker invocation issue (Task 7.2 blocker) is understood and resolved by using the direct python executable path.
*   The DB commit race condition is understood and resolved by committing before sending the message.
*   The broker configuration now correctly uses the environment variable.
*   However, the `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture in `conftest.py` is **still failing** to launch the worker subprocess correctly. The worker process appears to exit immediately, preventing the creation of the log file (`live_worker_output.log`) and blocking the E2E test from proceeding past the `pending` state.
*   Task 7.2 remains **paused/blocked** pending resolution of this fixture issue.

**Next Step:** Further investigate the `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture and the `subprocess.Popen` call to understand why it fails to launch the worker process when the same command works manually. This might involve simplifying the fixture further or exploring alternative ways to launch the worker within the test context.
