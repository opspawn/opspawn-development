# Debug Log: Task 7.2 - Minimal Test Case & Delay Imports Attempt

**Date:** 2025-04-13 (Afternoon Session)

**Goal:** Gain insights into Dramatiq worker CLI invocation issues by analyzing an external demo and creating/running a minimal test case. Subsequently, attempt to fix the issue in `ops-core` by delaying heavy imports.

## 1. Minimal Test Case Analysis & Execution

-   **Analysis:** Examined the `fastapi-rabbitmq-dramatiq-demo` project. Key findings:
    -   Standard `docker-compose.yml` setup for RabbitMQ and application.
    -   Broker configured globally in `app/actors/__init__.py` using `dramatiq.set_broker()` *before* importing actor modules (`app/actors/task.py`).
    -   Worker started via simple CLI command: `dramatiq app.actors`.
-   **Implementation:** Created a minimal Flask/Dramatiq/RabbitMQ test case in `1-t/flask-dramatiq-RabbitMQ-tests/`.
    -   Files created: `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `run_worker.sh`, `run_api.sh`, `README.md`.
    -   `app.py` configured the broker and defined the actor in the same file, mimicking the successful pattern observed in the minimal test case and external demo.
-   **Execution:**
    -   Successfully started a dedicated RabbitMQ container (`minimal-test-rabbit`) after resolving port/name conflicts with the main project's Docker setup.
    -   Created a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) and installed dependencies.
    -   Started the minimal worker (`./run_worker.sh`) and Flask API (`./run_api.sh`) in separate terminals.
    -   Sent a test task via `curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/submit/5`.
-   **Result:** **Success.** The API enqueued the task, and the worker received and processed it correctly, confirmed via logs.

## 2. Attempted Fix: Delay Imports (Idea 1)

-   **Hypothesis:** Heavy imports in `ops-core/src/ops_core/scheduler/engine.py` during worker startup (`dramatiq ops_core.tasks.worker`) cause delays or conflicts.
-   **Changes:**
    -   Modified `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/worker.py` to import `execute_agent_task_actor` directly from `engine.py` instead of importing the whole `engine` module.
    -   Modified `ops-core/src/ops_core/scheduler/engine.py` to move most imports (Agentkit, DB Store, LLM clients, dependencies) inside the `_run_agent_task_logic` and `_execute_agent_task_actor_impl` functions. Restored necessary interface imports (`BaseSecurityManager`, etc.) to the top level to fix initial `NameError`.
    -   Removed Prometheus middleware implicitly added via `prometheus-client` by clearing `broker.middleware` in `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/broker.py` to resolve `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use`.
-   **Testing:**
    -   Started the main project Docker services (`docker compose up -d`).
    -   Started the modified `ops-core` worker via `tox exec -- dramatiq ops_core.tasks.worker`. Worker started successfully without errors.
    -   Sent a test message using the modified `send_test_message_clean_env.py` script.
-   **Result:** **Failure.** The worker started, but when the message arrived, it failed with `dramatiq.errors.ActorNotFound: execute_agent_task_actor`. Although the main worker process logged that the actor *was* discovered during startup, the child worker process handling the message could not find it in the broker registry. Removing the `AsyncIO` middleware did not resolve this.

## 3. Findings & Insights

-   The core Dramatiq CLI invocation (`dramatiq <module>`), broker setup (`RabbitmqBroker`, `dramatiq.set_broker`), and basic actor definition/execution work correctly in a simple, isolated environment (minimal test case).
-   The "Delay Imports" strategy successfully resolved the worker *startup* errors (`NameError`, `OSError`) previously encountered with the `ops-core` worker CLI invocation.
-   However, delaying imports introduced a new problem: the worker processes could no longer find the registered actor when attempting to process a message, despite the main process initially discovering it. This suggests an issue with how Dramatiq shares or initializes the actor registry across processes when imports are heavily deferred *after* the initial module load triggered by the `dramatiq` command.
-   Removing the `AsyncIO` middleware did not fix the `ActorNotFound` issue, suggesting it's not directly related to the asyncio event loop management in this case.

## 4. Next Steps (Plan)

-   Revert the "Delay Imports" changes in `engine.py`, `worker.py`, and `broker.py`.
-   Proceed with **Idea 3: Refactor Actor Logic Location**. Move the `execute_agent_task_actor` definition (including the `@dramatiq.actor` decorator) out of `engine.py` into a new, dedicated file (e.g., `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/actors.py`). Update `worker.py` and `engine.py` (specifically the `submit_task` method) to import the actor from this new location. This aims to achieve the startup simplification benefits without interfering with Dramatiq's actor discovery mechanism across processes.
