# Debug Log: Task 7.2 - Direct Worker Execution Test

**Date:** 2025-04-13 (Evening Session)

**Goal:** Investigate if the Dramatiq worker (`ops_core.tasks.worker`) can process messages when run directly within the activated `tox` environment, bypassing potential interference from wrappers like `tox exec`.

**Hypothesis:** The previous failures (worker not processing messages) were caused by the invocation method (`tox exec -- dramatiq ...` or `subprocess` in tests) rather than the worker code itself.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Plan:** Created `PLANNING_step_7.2.10_direct_worker_test.md`.
2.  **Prerequisites:** Ensured Docker services (RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL) were running. Terminated any lingering worker processes.
3.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   Identified that `tox -r` run from `ops-core/` used the root `tox.ini` and created the environment at the project root (`1-t/.tox/`).
    *   Recreated the `tox` environment using `tox -r` in `ops-core/` (which actually updated the root `.tox/` environment).
4.  **Worker Execution:**
    *   Started the worker directly using the correct Python executable: `.tox/py/bin/python -m dramatiq ops_core.tasks.worker --verbose > worker_direct_run.log 2>&1 &`
5.  **Test Message:**
    *   Sent a message using the test script: `tox exec -e py -- python send_test_message_clean_env.py`
6.  **Observe Log:** Examined `worker_direct_run.log`.

**Findings & Conclusion:**

*   The worker log (`worker_direct_run.log`) clearly showed the "ACTOR ENTRY POINT REACHED" message for the test task (`test_task_001`).
*   This **confirms** that the worker **can** successfully receive and start processing messages when invoked directly using the correct Python interpreter from the `.tox` environment.
*   The subsequent `TaskNotFoundError` was expected, as the test message sender does not create a corresponding task record in the database.
*   **Conclusion:** The root cause of the message processing failures in Task 7.2 was indeed the invocation method used previously (e.g., `tox exec -- dramatiq ...`, `subprocess` in test fixtures). The direct invocation bypasses this interference.

**Next Step:**

*   Update the E2E test fixture (`live_dramatiq_worker` in `ops-core/tests/conftest.py`) to use the correct, direct invocation method: `.tox/py/bin/python -m dramatiq ...`.
