# Debug Log: Task 7.2 - E2E Test Fixture Debugging (Session 2 - Evening)

**Date:** 2025-04-13 (Evening Session Continued)

**Goal:** Debug why the `live_dramatiq_worker` fixture in `ops-core/tests/conftest.py` fails to launch a functional worker process via `subprocess.Popen`, even after correcting the invocation command.

**Initial State:**
*   Worker subprocess launched by fixture starts but exits immediately or fails silently.
*   Log file redirection (`live_worker_output.log`) from fixture does not work (file not created).
*   Manual execution of the same command via `tox exec ... python -m dramatiq ...` works.

**Debugging Steps & Findings:**

1.  **Attempt stdout/stderr PIPE Capture:** Modified fixture to use `stdout=subprocess.PIPE`, `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` and `process.communicate()` to capture output.
    *   Result: Test timed out. Fixture check showed process exited prematurely, but `communicate()` captured no output. Log file still not created.
2.  **Attempt stdout/stderr Redirection to Test Output:** Modified fixture to use `stdout=sys.stdout`, `stderr=sys.stderr`.
    *   Result: Test timed out. No worker output was interleaved with pytest logs.
3.  **Attempt Python Unbuffered Mode:** Added `-u` flag to python command in fixture.
    *   Result: Test timed out. Still no worker output visible.
4.  **Attempt Minimal Python Command:** Changed fixture command to `python -c 'print(...)'` to test basic subprocess execution and output redirection to `live_worker_output.log`.
    *   Result: Test timed out (expected). Fixture confirmed process ran until terminated. However, `live_worker_output.log` was *still not found*. This indicated a fundamental issue with subprocess output/file handling in the fixture context.
5.  **Attempt Wrapper Script:** Created `run_worker_wrapper.sh` to handle logging and execution. Modified fixture to run this script.
    *   Result: Test timed out (expected). Fixture confirmed wrapper script process started. However, the wrapper's log file (`/tmp/worker_wrapper_log.txt`) was *not found*.
6.  **Environment Variable Inspection:** Modified fixture to print the `worker_env` passed to `subprocess.Popen`.
    *   **Finding:** `PYTHONPATH` was missing from the environment dictionary.
7.  **Fix `PYTHONPATH`:** Modified fixture to explicitly construct and add `PYTHONPATH` (including `ops-core/src` and `agentkit/src`) to `worker_env`. Ran test with `subprocess.Popen` inheriting stdout/stderr.
    *   Result: Test timed out. Fixture confirmed worker process *did not* exit prematurely. However, still no worker output interleaved in pytest logs.
8.  **In-Process Thread Attempt:** Refactored fixture to run worker using `threading.Thread`.
    *   Result: Test timed out. Worker thread started but produced no logs and didn't process task.
9.  **In-Process Thread (Middleware Check):** Removed `AsyncIO` middleware from broker used by thread.
    *   Result: Test timed out. Still no worker logs or task processing.
10. **In-Process Thread (Broker Import Timing):** Moved broker import inside fixture after environment setup.
    *   Result: Test timed out. Still no worker logs or task processing.
11. **In-Process Thread (Library Debug Prints):** Added debug prints inside Dramatiq library (`worker.py`, `brokers/rabbitmq.py`).
    *   Result: Test timed out. Debug print inside `_WorkerThread.run()` was *not* reached. Debug print inside `RabbitmqBroker.connection` *was* reached before the test process was terminated unexpectedly (Signal 113). Library changes were reverted.
12. **Revert to Subprocess + Internal Logging:** Reverted fixture to `subprocess.Popen` with `PYTHONPATH` fix. Kept internal file logging within `worker.py` (writing to `worker_debug_log_{pid}.log`).
    *   Next Step (Paused): Run test and check for `worker_debug_log_{pid}.log`.

**Conclusion:**
The initial immediate exit of the worker subprocess was caused by a missing `PYTHONPATH`. Fixing this allows the process to start. However, subsequent attempts reveal persistent issues:
*   The worker process (when run via subprocess) still fails to process tasks.
*   Capturing stdout/stderr or log file output from the subprocess within the fixture context is unreliable (files not created, streams lost).
*   Running the worker in-process (thread/asyncio.to_thread) also fails, likely due to threading/event loop conflicts or silent errors within Dramatiq/Pika initialization in that context.
*   The most promising path seems to be the `subprocess.Popen` approach with the `PYTHONPATH` fix, combined with internal file logging from `worker.py` itself, but this needs verification.

**Next Step (Paused):** Re-run the test with the `subprocess.Popen` fixture (including `PYTHONPATH` fix) and check if the internal debug log `worker_debug_log_{pid}.log` is created by `worker.py`.
