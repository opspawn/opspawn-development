# Debugging Log: Dramatiq Worker Actor Invocation Issue

- **Date & Context:** 2025-04-12 (Evening Session)
- **Task:** [Task 7.2: Execute & Debug Live E2E Tests](../../TASK.md#task-72-execute--debug-live-e2e-tests)
- **Goal:** Diagnose why the `execute_agent_task_actor` is not being invoked by the Dramatiq worker process when running the `test_dramatiq_worker.py` isolation script.

## Initial Symptom

When running `test_dramatiq_worker.py`, the script successfully sends a message to the `execute_agent_task_actor` via RabbitMQ. The worker subprocess starts, initializes, and appears ready. However, the task status in the database remains `PENDING`, and the script eventually times out waiting for completion. Logs indicate the actor function itself is never entered.

## Affected Batch/Area

- Dramatiq message consumption/dispatch within the worker process.
- Interaction between `test_dramatiq_worker.py` (sender) and the worker subprocess (consumer/executor).
- Core files involved:
    - `test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    - `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/worker.py` (Worker entry point)
    - `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/broker.py` (Broker config)
    - `ops-core/src/ops_core/scheduler/engine.py` (Actor definition & implementation)

## Isolation Command

The primary isolation command used throughout this debugging session:

```bash
# Run from /home/sf2/Workspace/23-opspawn/1-t directory
.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py
```
(Flags like `-v`, `-p 1`, `-t 1` were added to the worker invocation *within* the script during debugging).

## Debugging Log (Chronological)

1.  **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:23 PM - Initial Run after Fixes
    *   **Action:** Ran `test_dramatiq_worker.py` after fixing previous issues (Alembic, DB, planner signature, etc.) and shortening agent timeout to 5s.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Script ran, worker started, task remained `PENDING`, script timed out after polling DB. No errors, but no progress.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Agent timeout (5s) might be too short, or worker isn't picking up the message.

2.  **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:23 PM - Reduce Script Wait Times
    *   **Action:** Modified `test_dramatiq_worker.py` to reduce `WORKER_STARTUP_WAIT` (5->2s), `TASK_COMPLETION_WAIT` (70->15s), and polling interval (5->1s).
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Faster execution, but same result: task `PENDING`, script timeout.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Script waits aren't the bottleneck. Issue is likely worker/actor execution.

3.  **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:24 PM - Increase Agent Timeout
    *   **Action:** Modified `ops-core/src/ops_core/scheduler/engine.py` to increase `AGENT_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT` from 5s to 20s.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Same result: task `PENDING`, script timeout. Worker logs show clean startup/shutdown.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Agent timeout isn't the primary issue; the actor code isn't even being reached.

4.  **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:25 PM - Simplify Actor Registration
    *   **Action:** Modified `ops-core/src/ops_core/scheduler/engine.py` to remove the check (`if _actor_name not in _broker.actors:`) and directly apply the `@dramatiq.actor` decorator.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Same result: task `PENDING`, script timeout.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Actor registration method wasn't the issue.

5.  **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:26 PM - Add Critical Actor Entry Log
    *   **Action:** Added `logger.critical("!!!!!! ACTOR ENTRY POINT REACHED...")` at the very beginning of `_execute_agent_task_actor_impl` in `engine.py`. Fixed resulting syntax errors.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Same result: task `PENDING`, script timeout. **Crucially, the critical log message did NOT appear in the worker's STDERR.**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Confirmed the actor function is *never* being called by the worker process. The issue is in message consumption or dispatch.

6.  **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:27 PM - Simplify Worker Command (Attempt 1)
    *   **Action:** Modified `test_dramatiq_worker.py` worker command to remove explicit broker path (`ops_core.tasks.broker:broker`), leaving only `ops_core.tasks.worker`.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Worker failed to start (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/worker'`).
    *   **Hypothesis:** Dramatiq CLI requires module path, not file path.

7.  **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:29 PM - Revert Worker Command
    *   **Action:** Reverted worker command in `test_dramatiq_worker.py` back to using module path `ops_core.tasks.worker`.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Worker started, task `PENDING`, no critical log. (Back to previous state).
    *   **Hypothesis:** Worker command structure wasn't the issue.

8.  **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:30 PM - Add Broker Type Log
    *   **Action:** Added `print("!!! BROKER CONFIGURED: ...")` statements in `ops-core/src/ops_core/tasks/broker.py`.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Worker STDERR showed `!!! BROKER CONFIGURED: RabbitmqBroker !!!`. Task `PENDING`, no critical actor log.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Worker subprocess is correctly identifying and configuring the RabbitMQ broker.

9.  **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:31 PM - Force Single Process/Thread
    *   **Action:** Added `-p 1 -t 1` flags to worker command in `test_dramatiq_worker.py`.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Worker started with 1 process/thread (visible in verbose logs). Task `PENDING`, no critical actor log.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Worker concurrency model isn't the issue.

10. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:31 PM - Remove AsyncIO Middleware
    *   **Action:** Commented out `broker.add_middleware(AsyncIO())` in `broker.py`.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Task `PENDING`, no critical actor log.
    *   **Hypothesis:** `AsyncIO` middleware isn't preventing initial message dispatch (though it would likely cause errors later if the actor *was* called).

11. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:36 PM - Restore AsyncIO, Remove Results Middleware
    *   **Action:** Restored `AsyncIO` middleware, removed `Results` middleware in `broker.py`. Removed diagnostic prints.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py`
    *   **Observation:** Task `PENDING`, no critical actor log.
    *   **Hypothesis:** `Results` middleware isn't the issue.

12. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 9:38 PM - Add Extensive Verbose Logging
    *   **Action:** Added `VERBOSE_LOG:` prefixed logs throughout `test_dramatiq_worker.py`, `worker.py`, and `engine.py`. Updated `testing_strategy.md`.
    *   **Command:** `.tox/py312/bin/python test_dramatiq_worker.py` (after fixing indentation errors from logging additions).
    *   **Observation:** Worker logs confirmed broker type, module imports, and actor discovery (`VERBOSE_LOG: Actor 'execute_agent_task_actor' FOUND...`). Task `PENDING`, no critical actor log.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Worker initialization seems correct up to the point of consuming/dispatching the message.

## Debugging Log (Cont. 2025-04-13 Morning)

13. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 10:27 PM - Verify RabbitMQ UI
    *   **Action:** Accessed http://localhost:15672, logged in guest/guest.
    *   **Observation:** UI accessible.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Port exposure successful.

14. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 10:27 PM - Run Test Script (Initial Fail)
    *   **Action:** Ran `python test_dramatiq_worker.py` directly.
    *   **Observation:** Failed (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'alembic'`).
    *   **Hypothesis:** Direct execution lacks `tox` environment dependencies.

15. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 10:27 PM - Run Test Script via `tox -e`
    *   **Action:** Ran `tox -e py312 -- python test_dramatiq_worker.py`.
    *   **Observation:** Failed (`ERROR: file or directory not found: python`).
    *   **Hypothesis:** `tox -e` passes args to default command (`pytest`).

16. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 10:27 PM - Run Test Script via `tox run`
    *   **Action:** Ran `tox run -e py312 -- dotenv run -- python test_dramatiq_worker.py`.
    *   **Observation:** Failed (`ERROR: file or directory not found: dotenv`).
    *   **Hypothesis:** `tox run` still interacting incorrectly with default command.

17. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 10:27 PM - Run Test Script via `tox exec`
    *   **Action:** Ran `tox exec -e py312 -- dotenv run -- python test_dramatiq_worker.py`.
    *   **Observation:** Script ran, task `PENDING`, timeout. Worker logs showed `Final Broker instance type: StubBroker`. RabbitMQ UI showed message "Unacked".
    *   **Hypothesis:** Worker subprocess inheriting `DRAMATIQ_TESTING=1` from `tox` environment. Main script sending correctly (Pika logs).

18. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 10:29 PM - Fix Worker Env Var
    *   **Action:** Modified `test_dramatiq_worker.py` to `del worker_env["DRAMATIQ_TESTING"]`.
    *   **Command:** `tox exec -e py312 -- dotenv run -- python test_dramatiq_worker.py`.
    *   **Observation:** Script ran, task `PENDING`, timeout. Worker logs showed `RabbitmqBroker`. Main script logs showed `StubBroker`.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Main script still using `StubBroker` due to env var at import time.

19. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 10:30 PM - Fix Main Script Env Var
    *   **Action:** Modified `test_dramatiq_worker.py` to `del os.environ["DRAMATIQ_TESTING"]` before broker import.
    *   **Command:** `tox exec -e py312 -- dotenv run -- python test_dramatiq_worker.py`.
    *   **Observation:** Script ran, task `PENDING`, timeout. Worker logs showed `RabbitmqBroker`. Main script logs showed `RabbitmqBroker`. RabbitMQ UI showed message stuck "Ready".
    *   **Hypothesis:** Worker connects but doesn't consume message.

20. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-12 10:31 PM - Fix Actor Async Def
    *   **Action:** Changed `_execute_agent_task_actor_impl` back to `async def`, restored internal `await` calls.
    *   **Command:** `tox exec -e py312 -- dotenv run -- python test_dramatiq_worker.py`.
    *   **Observation:** Script ran, task `PENDING`, timeout. Worker logs showed `RabbitmqBroker`. RabbitMQ UI showed message "Unacked". Critical actor log still missing.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Worker receives message but fails before actor code execution. Problem likely in Dramatiq internals or middleware.

21. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-13 05:35 AM - Isolate Worker Manually
    *   **Action:** Started worker manually (`tox exec ... python -m dramatiq ...`). Sent message via `send_test_message.py`.
    *   **Observation:** Worker started with `StubBroker` (due to `tox` env).
    *   **Hypothesis:** Need to unset `DRAMATIQ_TESTING` when running worker manually via `tox exec`.

22. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-13 05:38 AM - Isolate Worker Manually (Corrected Env)
    *   **Action:** Started worker manually (`tox exec ... env DRAMATIQ_TESTING= python -m dramatiq ...`). Sent message via `send_test_message.py`.
    *   **Observation:** Worker started with `RabbitmqBroker`. Message sent. **No new logs appeared in worker terminal after startup.** Critical actor log missing.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Failure occurs after message receipt, before actor invocation, even with correct broker and async def.

23. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-13 05:40 AM - Test: Remove AsyncIO Middleware
    *   **Action:** Commented out `AsyncIO` middleware in `broker.py`. Restarted worker, sent message.
    *   **Observation:** No change. Worker started, no new logs after message sent. Critical actor log missing. Restored middleware.
    *   **Hypothesis:** `AsyncIO` middleware not the cause of the pre-invocation failure.

24. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-13 05:44 AM - Test: Simplify Actor Code
    *   **Action:** Commented out all logic within `_execute_agent_task_actor_impl` except entry log and `asyncio.sleep`. Restarted worker, sent message.
    *   **Observation:** No change. Worker started, no new logs after message sent. Critical actor log missing. Restored actor code.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Actor's internal code is irrelevant; the function isn't being called.

25. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-13 05:46 AM - Test: Comment out `DRAMATIQ_TESTING` in `tox.ini`
    *   **Action:** Commented out `DRAMATIQ_TESTING = 1` in `tox.ini`. Restarted worker (without `env DRAMATIQ_TESTING=`), sent message.
    *   **Observation:** No change. Worker started with `RabbitmqBroker`, no new logs after message sent. Critical actor log missing.
    *   **Hypothesis:** `tox.ini` setting wasn't the root cause (though removing it is cleaner).

26. **Timestamp/Step:** ~2025-04-13 05:48 AM - Test: Pin Dramatiq Version
    *   **Action:** Pinned `dramatiq[rabbitmq]==1.16.0` in `ops-core/pyproject.toml`. Recreated tox env (`-r`), restarted worker, sent message.
    *   **Observation:** No change. Worker started (with 1.16.0), no new logs after message sent. Critical actor log missing. Reverted version pin.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Dramatiq version (1.17 vs 1.16) is not the cause.

## Root Cause (Conclusion of Session)

- Unknown. The worker process connects to RabbitMQ, receives the message (moves to "Unacked"), but fails silently before invoking the target actor function. This occurs consistently despite verifying broker configuration, async/await usage, environment variables, Dramatiq versions, middleware presence, and actor code complexity. The failure point is likely within Dramatiq's internal message dispatch or a subtle interaction with the `tox` environment/dependencies.

## Solution/Fix (TBD)

- Requires deeper investigation beyond application code:
    - Debug Dramatiq internals.
    - Systematically isolate dependencies.
    - Seek external help (e.g., Dramatiq GitHub issues).

## Verification Steps (Next Session)

- Attempt running the full E2E tests (`test_live_e2e.py`) to see if behavior differs.
- OR, begin deeper dependency analysis / Dramatiq internal debugging.

## Learnings/Takeaways

- Debugging distributed systems/message queues can be complex.
- Verbose logging is essential but doesn't always pinpoint the issue if the failure occurs within the library's internal dispatch mechanism.
- Isolating components (like using the worker script) is valuable but may still hit roadblocks requiring deeper dives or different isolation approaches.
- The recursive isolation strategy documented in `testing_strategy.md` provides a good framework for tackling such issues.
- Environment variable inheritance (especially within `tox`) needs careful management.
