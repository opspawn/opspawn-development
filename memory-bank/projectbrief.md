# Project Brief: Opspawn Core Foundation

**Goal:** Build the Opspawn Core Foundation, a modular, agentic infrastructure designed for developing and orchestrating AI agents.

**Core Requirements:**
- Develop two primary components:
    - **agentkit:** A modular toolkit for building LLM-powered agents with capabilities for memory management, dynamic tool integration, and planning.
    - **ops-core:** An orchestration engine to manage task execution, scheduling, state tracking, and workflow coordination for agents built with agentkit.
- Follow the phased development plan outlined in `23-opspawn/1-t/TASK.md`, starting with initialization and research, moving through core module development, integration, testing, and documentation.
- Adhere to the architectural principles, technology stack (Python, FastAPI, gRPC, etc.), and design patterns specified in `23-opspawn/1-t/PLANNING.md` and the associated research documents.
- Follow the specific coding standards, testing requirements, and documentation practices defined in `23-opspawn/1-t/.clinerules/project-guidelines.md`.
- The primary workspace for this project is `/home/sf2/Workspace/23-opspawn/1-t`.
