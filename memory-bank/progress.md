# Progress: Opspawn Core Foundation (Phase 4 Completed)

## Current Status (Updated 2025-04-08 5:37 AM)
- **Phase:** Phase 2: Core Module Reimplementation.
- **Overall Progress:** Phases 1, 3, and 4 completed (functionality may be blocked by missing Phase 2 core). Tasks 2.1 and 5.1 completed. Phase 5 deferred. Phase 2 Tasks 2.5-2.10 files created but blocked. Tasks 2.2-2.4 require reimplementation.
- **Current Task:** Starting Task 2.3 (Reimplementation: Agentkit Dynamic Tool Integration).

## What Works
- **Task 2.1 (Reimplemented):** `ops_core` scheduler and metadata store MVP reimplemented. All 104 `ops-core` tests pass via `tox`.
- **Task 2.2 (Reimplemented):** `agentkit` core agent MVP reimplemented (`ShortTermMemory`, `PlaceholderPlanner`, `Agent`, interfaces, tests).
- **Task 2.3 (Reimplemented):** `agentkit` dynamic tool integration reimplemented (`schemas`, `registry`, `execution`, tests, agent integration).
- **Task 2.4 (Reimplemented):** `agentkit` internal interfaces defined and implemented/verified during Tasks 2.2 & 2.3.
- **Task 2.11 (Completed):** Agent tests updated for tool call flow.
- **Task 2.12 (Completed):** LLM configuration and instantiation implemented in `ops-core`.
- **Phase 2 LLM Clients/Planner (Files Exist, Integrated):**

    - Task 2.6: `OpenAiClient` implemented and tested (`agentkit/llm_clients/openai_client.py`, `tests/llm_clients/test_openai_client.py`).
    - Task 2.7: `AnthropicClient` implemented and tested (`agentkit/llm_clients/anthropic_client.py`, `tests/llm_clients/test_anthropic_client.py`).
    - Task 2.8: `GoogleClient` implemented and tested (`agentkit/llm_clients/google_client.py`, `tests/llm_clients/test_google_client.py`).
    - Task 2.9: `OpenRouterClient` implemented and tested (`agentkit/llm_clients/openrouter_client.py`, `tests/llm_clients/test_openrouter_client.py`).
    - Task 2.10: `ReActPlanner` implemented and tested (`agentkit/planning/react_planner.py`, `tests/planning/test_react_planner.py`). Depends on missing `BasePlanner`.
- **Phase 1:** Setup tasks completed.
- **Phase 3 (Files Exist, Blocked):**
    - Task 3.1: REST API files exist but depend on missing Task 2.1.
    - Task 3.2: gRPC files exist but depend on missing Task 2.4.
    - Task 3.3: Integration files exist but depend on blocked Tasks 3.1/3.2.
    - Task 3.4: Async messaging files exist (Dramatiq/RabbitMQ setup seems okay).
    - Task 3.5: Integration test files exist but depend on blocked tasks.
- **Phase 3.5 MCP (Partially Blocked):**
    - Task MCP.1 & MCP.2: Client and Config files exist and seem okay.
    - Task MCP.3 & MCP.4: Proxy injection logic and spec depend on missing Tasks 2.1/2.3/2.4.
    - Task MCP.6: Integration tests exist but depend on blocked tasks.
- **Phase 4 (Completed, but based on previously assumed state):**
    - Task 4.1: Unit tests exist for Phase 3+ components.
    - Task 4.2: E2E tests exist but depend on missing Phase 2 core.
    - Task 4.3: Load testing setup completed.
    - Task 4.4: Security/Error handling tests completed for existing Phase 3+ components.
    - Task 4.5: Testing documentation created.
- **Maintenance:**
    - Task Maint.1: Test warnings fixed.
- **Phase 5:**
    - Task 5.1: API documentation sources enhanced.
- **Maintenance:**
    - Task Maint.1: Test warnings fixed.
    - Task Maint.2: Agentkit import/test fixes (Partially Completed 2025-04-08).

## What Works (As of 2025-04-08 ~6:34 AM)
- **`ops-core`:** All 104 tests passed via `tox` after Task 2.1 reimplementation. Subsequent changes (LLM integration in Task 2.12) have not been re-tested with `tox`.
- **`agentkit`:**
    - Core components (Agent, Memory, Planner, Tools, Interfaces) reimplemented (Tasks 2.2-2.4).
    - LLM Clients (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter) implemented (Tasks 2.6-2.9).
    - ReAct Planner implemented (Task 2.10).
    - LLM integration into Agent/Ops-core completed (Tasks 2.11-2.12).
    - **Import/Structure Fixes (Task Maint.2):** Circular imports resolved, missing definitions added, source files moved to correct `agentkit/agentkit/` subdirs, venv recreated, dependencies installed, Pydantic error fixed. **Test execution is pending final verification.**
- **Integration:** Async messaging (Dramatiq/RabbitMQ) implemented and verified via unit/integration tests (Task 3.4). MCP client/config implemented (MCP.1, MCP.2).
- **Testing:** Load testing setup complete (Task 4.3). Security/Error handling tests added for existing components (Task 4.4). Testing docs created (Task 4.5). API docs enhanced (Task 5.1).

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Focus)
- **Complete Task Maint.2:** Run `pytest tests` in `agentkit/.venv` to verify all fixes and ensure tests pass.
- **Verify `ops-core` Tests:** Run `cd ops_core && tox` to ensure no regressions after Task 2.12.
- **Task MCP.5 (Blocked):** Enhance `agentkit` Planner/Agent (Optional). (Next Task - Optional)

## What's Left to Build (High-Level from `TASK.md`)
- **Phase 2:** Core Module Reimplementation (Tasks 2.1-2.4), LLM Integration (Tasks 2.5-2.12).
- **Phase 3:** Integration & Interface Development (Tasks 3.1-3.5, MCP Tasks). (Currently Blocked/Partially Blocked)
- **Phase 4:** Testing & Validation (Tasks 4.1-4.5). (Completed based on assumed state, may need re-validation)
- **Phase 5:** Documentation & Finalization (Tasks 5.1-5.5). (Task 5.1 Done, Rest Deferred)

## Known Issues / Blockers
- **Agentkit Test Status:** Final verification run of `agentkit` tests was interrupted before completion (Task Maint.2). Status unknown.
- **Ops-Core Test Status:** `ops-core` tests (`tox`) have not been run since Task 2.12 (LLM integration) was completed. Status unknown.
- `InMemoryMetadataStore` (Reimplemented) is not persistent or thread-safe (MVP limitation).
- CI workflows currently lack linting/type checking steps (commented out).
- Integration testing of Dramatiq actor dependencies remains challenging (`memory-bank/integration_test_challenges.md`).
- **File Structure Correction (2025-04-08):** Discovered that LLM client, planner, and interface files were created outside the main `agentkit/agentkit/` source directory. Moved files to correct locations during Task Maint.2.
- **Virtual Environment Recreation (2025-04-08):** Recreated `agentkit/.venv` due to "bad interpreter" error during Task Maint.2.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
